## Getting Started
To run this project locally, you'll need to set up a **virtual environment** and install the **required dependencies**. Follow the steps below to get started.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.10.11 or higher) installed on your system.

 
### Setting up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a way to isolate your project's dependencies. It's a good practice to use one to avoid conflicts with other projects. To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of your project.

2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
You'll now be working within the virtual environment, and you can deactivate it by running `deactivate` in the terminal.

### Installing Dependencies
This project uses a requirements.txt file to specify its dependencies. To install these dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated (as explained in the previous section).

2. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
